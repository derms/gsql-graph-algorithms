  algorithm:
    name: Single Source Shortest Path (Weighted, Any Sign)
    filename: "tg_shortest_ss_any_wt.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: "This algorithm assumes that edges in the graph can be both positive or negative. If there is more than one path with the same total weight, the algorithm returns one of them."
    schema_constraints: This algorithm requires an INT, FLOAT, or DOUBLE weight attribute on the target edge types. This algorithm can also optionally write the result (INT, FLOAT, or DOUBLE) to an attribute of the respective type on each visited vertex.
