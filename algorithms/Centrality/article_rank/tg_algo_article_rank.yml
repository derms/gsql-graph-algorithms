  algorithm:
    name: Article Rank
    filename: "tg_article_rank.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: "Measures the influence of vertices in a graph. Article rank retains the basic PageRank methodology but lowers the influence of low-degree nodes."
    schema_constraints: If you want to write the results of this algorithm (FLOAT) back to the vertices, you must have a FLOAT attribute on the target vertex type.
